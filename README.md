##Lesson 1
###Fizz Buzz Project
This is the Fizz Buzz that was provided as an exercise in step 6. The program is run either by passing in a numeric value as an argument or with no arguments. If no argument is passed in, the user is prompted to provice a value. This is used for an upper limit when running the Fizz Buzz program.

Enjoy!

##Lesson 3 
##Pirate Bartender

The next saga in my learning journey is a program that has a cheecky pirate bartender asking a client whether what characteristics they like their drinks to have. Once all his questions are answered he mixes up a magic cocktail for your enjoyment. The current version of the program consists of the basic requirments at the moment. Expect more iterations soon.

Have a drink on the house!
